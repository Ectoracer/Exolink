            <h2>Exolink collects minimal information about you.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A general overview of requests sent to the server are logged for debugging purposes. Each request has a unique ID.</li>
                <li>Links you make through Exolink, as well as links you get metadata about that haven't been seen before, are logged and sent to a public Discord channel.</li>
                <li>Image links are filtered from the logs - but the operator may know that an image was loaded.</li>
                <li>The link you're accessing in the link directory is filtered from the logs - but the operator may know that a link was accessed.</li>
                <li>That's it.</li>
                <li>Your IP address, browser, user agent, and/or other personally identifiable information are all <u>NOT</u> logged.</li>

            <h2>Some parts of Exolink connect to other services.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://fontlay.com">Fontlay</a> is a proxy for <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a>. Your IP is not shared with Google, and according to Fontlay, nothing is logged. Your browser directly connects to Fontlay, and Fontlay then talks to Google. <i>You</i> are <u>NOT</u> subject to Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> or <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Fontlay does not appear to have a privacy policy or a terms of service.</li>
                <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/">Firebase Dynamic Links</a> are links provided by Google. The Exoracer app generates these links when you share a level. Your browser sends no requests to Google - Exolink makes this request directly from the server to Google, and then gets what it needs and gives it back. <i>You</i> are <u>NOT</u> subject to Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> or <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
                <li>Exolink's servers may contact GitHub when you visit a link in the link directory or get metadata for a link. We contact GitHub to confirm whether or not a link exists in our directory. Your browser does not connect to GitHub - we do, and only in the event that we don't have a link locally stored. This fetch also happens if you attempt to visit a page that doesn't exist. <i>You</i> are <u>NOT</u> subject to GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement">General Privacy Statement</a> or <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
                <li>Exolink's servers may also fetch images when visiting a link in the link directory. Your browser does not connect to an external server - it connects to us, and then we get the image for you and return it.</li>
